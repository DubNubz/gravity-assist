## Ship Data

Feel free to use my data, which can be found in [`/server/api/data/ships.ts`](./server/api/data/ships.ts).

To quickly convert the data to JSON, you can copy the array object and run `JSON.stringify(<data>)` in your browser console.

Each ship follows the data structures in their type declarations in [`/utils/ships.ts`](./utils/ships.ts).

## Project Setup

If you wish to run the site locally:

1. Ensure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) is installed.

2. Create a `.env` file in the root of the project: (optional maybe? idk try it out)

```sh
NUXT_BASE64_SERVICE_ACCOUNT= # wrap the value in ''
NUXT_BASE_URL=
```

3. Install dependencies and run locally:

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

4. The site should be running on http:\//localhost:3000.
